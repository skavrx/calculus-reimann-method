This application uses Java and JavaFX to calculate and create graphs that show the estimates for the area under a given funtion. 
This is by using Reimann's method which forms rectangles under the function to estimate the area. The areas that can be used for 
this application are the Left Handed (Lower) method, Right Handed (Upper) method, the midpoint method, and the trapezoidal method.

## The Area Class

The Area class is the object where a function is defined and the area is found for it.
