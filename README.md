# Calculus Reimann Method

This application uses Java and JavaFX to calculate and create graphs that show the estimates for the area under a given funtion. 
This is by using Reimann's method which forms rectangles under the function to estimate the area. The areas that can be used for 
this application are the Left Handed (Lower) method, Right Handed (Upper) method, the midpoint method, and the trapezoidal method.
